# Gravitational-Wave-Signatures-of-Structural-Complexity-in-Radiating-Collapse
Python script for generating publication-quality gravitational wave ringdown plots. Visualizes the frequency shift and anomalous damping caused by structural complexity ( Y T F Y  TF ​   ) in radiating gravitational collapse, formatted for APS/PRD journals.
